# IPE

> Insanely Productive Environment

`ipe` is a simple bashscript wrapping a few productive tools to automate
daily workflows. It features:

- `cd` instantely in the right folder (thanks to [z][z])
- Drop you in a productive terminal with [tmux][tmux]
- Auto-(un)load commands, aliases, environment variables, per-project to
  cross-machines (thanks to [autoenv][autoenv])
- Dead-simple extension system

**WIP, more to come soon**
